```{r "Initialization"}
library(lubridate)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)

```


## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r "Loading"}
zipfile <- "activity.zip"
activityFileName <- "activity.csv"

activities <- read.csv(unz(zipfile, activityFileName))
activities$date <- ymd(activities$date)

```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r "steps per day"}
activities.dt <- as.data.table(activities)

totalStepsPerDay <- activities.dt[!is.na(steps),list(totalSteps=sum(steps)), by=date]
summary(totalStepsPerDay)

#hist(totalStepsPerDay[,totalSteps], breaks="FD")
breaks <- pretty(range(totalStepsPerDay[,totalSteps],na.rm=TRUE), n = nclass.FD(totalStepsPerDay[,totalSteps]), min.n = 1)
g <- ggplot(totalStepsPerDay, aes(x=totalSteps))
g <- g + geom_histogram(breaks=breaks)
g + geom_rug() 

# mean and median total steps per day
totalStepsPerDay[,list(
    mean=mean(totalSteps), 
    median=median(totalSteps))]
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r "Average daily activity"}

```


## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
